# kubeapply-test-cluster

This directory contains examples of different kinds of `kubeapply` configs. The
sections below describe how to run through a typical `kubeapply` workflow and
provision the associated resources in a small, local cluster.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you've installed `kubeapply` and all of the dependencies described in the
[main README](/README.md#installing).

Then, install [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/), which we'll use to run a
local cluster. It's also possible to run this example against something like
[`minikube`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) or a real, remote cluster,
but you'll need to alter some of the steps below.

## Directory layout

The following are included at the top-level:

| Path | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [`cluster-local1.yaml`](/examples/kubeapply-test-cluster/cluster-local1.yaml) | Cluster config for first version of our test cluster. Contains basic information about the cluster as well as parameters for template expansion and/or starlark evaluation. |
| [`cluster-local2.yaml`](/examples/kubeapply-test-cluster/cluster-local2.yaml) | Cluster config for alternative version of the test cluster. Uses same profile as first version, but has different expansion parameters. Not used in sample workflow below, but left as an example of how different cluster instances in different environments and/or regions might be configured. |
| [`charts`](/examples/kubeapply-test-cluster/charts) | Contains an example `envoy` chart that's referred to in the `profile`. `kubeapply` can also source charts from git, http, or s3. |
| [`expanded`](/examples/kubeapply-test-cluster/expanded) |  Expanded Kubernetes configs generated by running `kubeapply expand`. These can be applied in the cluster by running `kubeapply apply` or directly via `kubectl apply`. |
| [`profile`](/examples/kubeapply-test-cluster/profile) | Source templates and starlark files for our cluster, used by `kubeapply expand` to fill out the `expanded` directory. |

The `profile` directory contains configs for three "services", each of which demonstrates a
different way of specifying configs for expansion:

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [`echoserver`](/examples/kubeapply-test-cluster/profile/apps/echoserver) |  Uses plain Kubernetes YAML and go-templated YAML. |
| [`envoy`](/examples/kubeapply-test-cluster/profile/apps/envoy) | Uses the `envoy` Helm chart to generate configs for an Envoy deployment. |
| [`redis`](/examples/kubeapply-test-cluster/profile/apps/redis) | Uses [skycfg](https://github.com/stripe/skycfg), which evaluates [starlark](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/language.html) to generate configs. |

## Workflow

The steps below use the provided [`Makefile`](/examples/kubeapply-test-cluster/Makefile) for
convenience, but you can also just run the associated `kubeapply` commands directly.

##### (1) `make start-kind`

Starts up a local cluster via kind and dumps a kubeconfig in `.kube/kubeapply-test-cluster.yaml`.

##### (2) `make expand`

Expands configs from `profile` into the `expanded` directory for `cluster-local1`.
It should be a no-op from the git perspective unless you've made changes in the cluster
config or profile files.

##### (3) `make validate`

Runs `kubeconform` over the expanded configs to validate that they are legitimate Kubernetes
configs before continuing.

##### (4) `make diff`

Runs `kubectl diff` against the local cluster and shows the results in a pretty format in the
terminal.

##### (5) `make apply`

Runs `kubectl apply` against the local cluster and outputs a table that summarizes the changes
that were made.

##### (6) `kubectl ...`

Run `kubectl --kubeconfig=.kube/kubeapply-test-cluster.yaml get pods --all-namespaces`, etc.
to verify that the apply worked correctly!

##### (7) `make stop-kind`

Stops local cluster created in first step and deletes the kubeconfig.
